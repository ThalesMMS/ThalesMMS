## About Me

I'm a physician and computer science undergraduate exploring how software engineering and artificial intelligence can advance radiological practice. My radiology experience is hospital-based diagnostic imaging, including emergency/trauma and oncologic care. I have hands-on contributions to DICOM viewers, PACS infrastructure, and exploratory AI tooling for healthcare and medical imaging, and I'm comfortable moving from clinical questions to code and back. My main technical interests include:

- DICOM viewers with 2D/MPR/volumetric rendering and DIMSE/DICOMweb integration
- Generative AI in medicine (LLMs/Agents, local inference, RAG/finetuning)
- Infrastructure for healthcare systems (PACS, NAS, EHR, and other systems)
- AI-assisted software engineering and developer tooling
- Full-stack development tailored to clinical workflows

## Current Projects

**Isis DICOM Viewer** (Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS): built natively in Swift for Apple platforms and developed in Qt/C++ for Windows, providing 2D visualization, MPR, volumetric rendering, PACS/DIMSE support, and ROI measurement tools (closed source).

[**MTK - Metal Toolkit**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/MTK): Modern Swift/Metal toolkit for high-fidelity medical imaging (volume rendering, SceneKit integration, SwiftUI components).

[**Dicom-Tools**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/Dicom-Tools): Test the major DICOM libraries across C++, Python, Rust, Java, C#, and Javascript using a single command interface, shared samples, and interchangeable backends.

[**JFlutter**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/JFlutter): Cross-platform interactive educational tool to design and simulate automata, regular expressions, formal languages and Turing machines. Mobile‑first, touch‑optimised UI.

## Other Projects

[**DICOM-Decoder**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/DICOM-Decoder): DICOM Pixel decode & windowing pipeline

[**Radiology-Templates**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/Radiology-Templates): Radiology report templates with Rust/Python tools to convert across DOCX, Markdown, and TXT.

[**DcmSwift**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/DcmSwift): Swift-native DICOM core (DIMSE + DICOMweb)

[**TotalSegmentator Horos Plugin**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/TotalSegmentator-Horos-Plugin): Bringing the modern TotalSegmentator to the open-source Horos Project!

[**GitHub-Replicant**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/GitHub-Replicant-rs): Fast, async Rust CLI for bulk GitHub repository backup. Sync repositories from users, starred repos, followers, or following accounts. Automatically detects existing repos (clone vs pull).

[**Code-Scanner**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/Code-Scanner-py): Python/Rust/Shell tools to generate clean text snapshots of your source code tree with one command. Perfect for reviews, audits, and AI prompts.

[**mammography-pipelines**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/mammography-pipelines-py): Mammography experimentation repo delivering reproducible preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling steps. Run ResNet50 or EfficientNet B0 extractors for full training loops and density classifiers.

[**WALL-ET**](https://github.com/ThalesMMS/WALL-ET): Mobile Bitcoin wallet (WIP)

**Orthanc for QNAP**: Custom `.qpkg` packaging

**LLMs + Radiology**: Fine-tuning and RAG pipelines with anonymized radiology data
